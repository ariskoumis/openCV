#Overview
Hello! This repository is a collection of various projects, notes and demonstrations of Object Recognition primarily using openCV.

#SJSU Robotics
Lots of the content here is made for The 2017 SJSU Robotics Team. We are currently participating in The Mars Society's 2017 University Rover Challenge. Part of this competition requires our team's rover to autonomously navigate through multiple pairs of pillars, indentifiable by tennis balls affixed to the top of each pole.

To read more about the competition guidelines, here is [University Rover Challenge's Website](http://urc.marssociety.org/), and [here are the guidelines.](https://7aec5dcb-a-3f6a8980-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/marssociety.org/urc/files/University%20Rover%20Challenge%20Rules%202017.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crOnzmieDMKr6WQ1NkGf9MYWuoh56TK9FMJ8qHZgArp216UtmjiUb0eObRjiZ4fyKQ2OhUdNBAVIaNm5klPQIJuV4iH9ew_Wxd-etJanF9lx1KXRHX0c84J5xWUM9RZ_Zsms5tDefxjeDnloX4P2WK0InDF4iGrLdOfF4zwV5jQMVvdFK1-SouO29VLdskRSZ5Bb3zq734CT28zt_AkWB8AiiVeETgMXC9ESg0pJ_cdlTVzF92zx30qIPt3fRN4o8Rg2pCZ&attredirects=0)

#Additional Content
As I make progress with Object Recognition, I will be updating my youtube with releant videos. Below are my videos (so far).
